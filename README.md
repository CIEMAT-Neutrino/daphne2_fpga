# DAPHNE2 Firmware

## Overview of Firmware Modules

### Front End Logic

New for this firmware is a fully automatic front end. DAPHNE has 5 AFE chips, each with 8 high speed serial data outputs. This front end logic adjusts the input data streams so that the sample clock is in the optimal center of the eye (IDELAYE2), and then adjusts the serial to parallel shift register logic (ISERDESE2) to properly recover the 14 bit parallel data. Works for all 40 AFE channels and requires no user intervention aside from a soft reset after the FPGA is programmed. 

The output of the front end logic is 40 14-bit data buses synchronized to the master 62.5 MHz clock domain.

### Core Logic

The core logic contains the sender firmware. The senders take the raw AFE data (after it has been aligned to the master clock) and form output records. Output records are sent downstream to DAQ over high speed serial links. Two senders have been developed.

#### Streaming

The streaming sender design takes 4 AFE data streams and packs 64 samples from each stream them into an output frame for transmission to FELIX DAQ. The output link runs at 4.809 Gbps. This design runs continuously and there are a few idle words inserted between output frames. This version of the firmware has four streaming senders instantiated. Output link DAQ0 sends AFE0 channels 0,1,2,3. Output link DAQ1 sends AFE1 channels 0,1,2,3. etc. etc.

#### Self-Triggered 

The self triggered sender is built upon a modular approach. The STC module monitors a single AFE data stream. It waits until a trigger condition is satisfied, then it grabs the 1024 samples (including 64 pre-trigger samples), forms an output frame around this data, and stores this frame in a FIFO. This FIFO is deep enough to store ~8.9 events. Then, on the backend, a state machine scans across N modules looking to see who has an output record ready to send in the FIFO. In a round robin manner these STC modules are selected to dump data to the output link to FELIX. And the process repeats. The current design has 10 input modules feeding one output, but can easily be changed to have any number of input modules feeding one output. This version of the firmware currently does not include any self-triggered senders.

### Timing Endpoint

The timing endpoint firmware block interfaces to the DAPHNE timing input (optical link) and generates the master 62.5 MHz clock and a 64 bit timestamp. The timing endpoint design used here is the NEW style timing protocol based on pulse width modulated clock at 62.5MHz. An external ADN2814 clock and data recovery chip is present, but this new timing scheme no longer requires it. The AD2814 clock output is not used by the new timing endpoint logic, and the DATAOUT signal is the encoded clock. The "pdts" endpoint logic was developed by Dave Newbold and others at Bristol UK and adapted to DAPHNE by Adrian @ UPENN. Through the GbE interface the user can monitor all status bits related to the timing endpoint and control status bits as well. The most important control bit selects either the local clocks (with fake timestamp) or timing endpoint to run the FPGA.

### Spy Buffers

#### Input Spy Buffers

When triggered, the spy buffers will capture 64 pre-trigger samples followed by 4032 samples on EACH AFE channel. These buffers are memory mapped into the GBE internal address space and then can be read out at any time. The trigger may come from an external input to the DAPHNE2 board or by writing to a particular register in the GbE address space.

#### Output Spy Buffers

Output spy buffers capture the data that the core is sending on the DAQ0 output link. This spy buffer is 32 bits wide and 4k deep. It is triggered along with the input spy buffers.

### Gigabit Ethernet (GbE)

The GbE interface is a simple way to access FPGA internal registers and memory buffers from a PC. The GbE interface is always active, but is not required for operation. This interface is intended for debugging and provides fast access to various spy buffers and registers. This interface is based on the "off the shelf Ethernet Interface" developed at Fermilab by Ryan Rivera and Lorenzo Uplegger. The default IP address is 192.168.133.12. Example python code is located in src/oei/python.

### SPI Slave

SPI slave logic is used for communication with the microcontroller. A pair of FIFOs are used to access this SPI slave device from the GbE interface.

## Overview of Hardware Subsystems

### Front Panel Index

The front panel numbers the AFE ports	0 1 2 4 5 (left to right).
The schematic/PCB numbers the AFE buses	0 4 3 2 1 
This firmware now uses the front panel scheme, change made in the constraints file.

### Board Revision

This firmware is designed for the DAPHNE V2A hardware only. It cannot be used on DAPHNE V1 boards.

### Clocks

The programmable clock generator U18 should be configured to output the following clocks: 

* CLK0 = 120.327MHz connects to MGT Quad 216, REFCLK0, pins F11/E11. Used for FELIX DAQ.
* CLK1 = 100MHz connects to bank 33, pins AA4/AB4. General purpose clock.
* CLK2 = 62.5MHz connects to bank 33, pins AA3/AA2. Currently unused.
* CLK3 = 125MHz connects to MGT Quad 213, REFCLK0, pins AA13/AB13. Used for GBE.

This firmware design uses the 100MHz system clock to generate the master clock and other internal clocks used by the firmware design. 

The FPGA outputs a 62.5MHz clock on pins AF5/AF4. This clock goes to clock fanout buffer U20 and then copies of this clock go the 5 AFE chips.

Note that the OEICLK (125MHz for GbE operations) and DAQCLK (120.237MHz for output link sender logic) are generated from their respective GTP reference clock inputs. These clocks are generated by the MMCM/PLL contained in their respective GTP Quad modules. 

If the clock generator U18 is ever re-configured by the microcontroller this can certainly affect the clocks going to the FPGA, and in that case the micro should hard reset the FPGA after the U18 output clocks are stable.

### Reset Sequencing

The front end alignment logic uses a number of different clocks and reset signals, so this sequencing is managed by a new module called clock_reset. The firmware design distinguishes between two different types of resets:

* A HARD RESET is an external signal controlled by the microcontroller. When asserted, the main MMCM/PLL in the FPGA is reset, and this momentarily disrupts all clocks output from this MMCM. After some time the MMCM returns to normal operation (locked=1) and then a state machine generates a sequence of reset pulses which are synchronized to various clock domains in the design.

* A SOFT RESET is generated by the user writing to a specific register in the GbE interface. When a soft reset is issued the main MMCM is not reset and all board clocks continue to run normally, and the reset signals are momentarily pulsed in their respective clock domains.

Normally a hard reset should not be needed. The FPGA should be programmed AFTER the microcontroller has initialized the clock generator U18. A soft reset is recommended after the FPGA is initialized, or any time the automatic front end logic reports bit errors in the framing pattern.

### Timing Interface

The DAPHNE2 board includes the CDR chip ADN2814CPZ U16. This device sends differential clock and data, as well as LOS and LOL indicators, to to FPGA. Currently this interface is unused and we running with the local clocks only.

### Gigabit Ethernet

This firmware uses a Gigabit Ethernet Interface based on the OEI "Off the Shelf Ethernet Interface" developed by Ryan Rivera. This Ethernet interface is fiber and the SFP module connects to Quad 213, channel 0. The default IP address for this interface is 192.168.133.12.

### High Speed Serial Links

Quad 213 channel 0 is used for GbE. The FPGA can control the TX_DISABLE pin on this SFP. The FPGA can monitor the LOS and ABS signals on the SFP, as well as communicate with the SFP management interface (I2C).

Quad 216 is used for FELIX DAQ links. All four channels in this quad may be used. For FELIX generally only the MGT TX is used and the RX is disabled for each transceiver. The FPGA can control the TX_DISABLE, monitor the LOS and ABS signals, and communicate with the SFP management interface (I2C).

### Microcontroller Interface (Slow Controls)

The FPGA firmware features and SPI slave that is used to communicate with the microcontroller. Two FIFOs are used to attach this slave SPI to the GbE interface. Command strings are written into the CMD FIFO (2k x 8). The command string must be less than 512 bytes ASCII data and terminated with 0x0d (CR) or 0x0a (LF). When the CMD FIFO has some data the SPI slave raises the SPI_IRQ line. The microcontroller then fetches the command string via the SPI interface, does the command, and writes any response string back to the SPI slave, which then stores it into the RES FIFO which can be read by the user through the GbE interface. If the user attempts to read an empty RES FIFO then 0xFF will be returned. This SPI interface between the FPGA and the microcontroller replaces the 100BASE-X Ethernet inteface on the microcontroller.

Also note that the DAPHNE microcontroller can hard reset the FPGA by pulling the RESETn line LOW momentarily. (There is a command to do this!)

### External Trigger

The external interface trigger is now optically isolated. The input is 5-12VDC on an SMB connector (center positive). Note that the optoisolator device used on DAPHNE has an inverted output, so this inversion must be addressed in firmware.

### Status LEDs

There are 5 status LEDs. All are pulse stretched in the firmware so that momentary pulses are visible. The LED closest to the SFP Timing Interface connector is reserved for the microcontroller.

* uC LED: blinks at 1Hz when the microcontroller is programmed
* LED0: ON if the master clock MMCM is LOCKED
* LED1: ON if the automatic front end AFE alignment is done
* LED2: ON if the timing endpoint is locked and timestamp is valid
* LED3: ON if the GbE link is up and the speed is 1000
* LED4: ON if there is activity on the GbE link
* LED5: ON if there if the spy buffers are triggered (externally or internally via GbE)

## Simulation

Many of the firmware modules have separate testbench files, written in VHDL. The simulator I use is Aldec Active-HDL. The Vivado simulator should also work with some modifications.

## Debug

Firmware MAY include a Xilinx "chipscope" Internal Logic Analyzer. See xilinx\output\probes.ltx for details.


## Build Instructions

This design is intended to be built in Vivado Non-Project mode. In a command line window cd to the src/xilinx directory and type: 

	vivado -mode tcl -source vivado_batch.tcl

After vivado completes the output reports and bit file should be located in the src/xilinx/output directory. It is recommended to NOT use the Vivado GUI ("project mode") to build this design; some settings in the tcl script will likely not be applied properly if that design flow is attempted.

The timing constraints for this design were carefully written to provide complete timing coverage and also address the many different clock domains present in this design. After building the firmware be sure to look at the file src/xilinx/output/post_route_timing_summary.rpt and look for the text "All user specified timing constraints are met". If the design does not meet timing there will be negative slack in the worst case timing paths that will need to be addressed.
